Hello Raytracer
===============

Rather than creating the standard 'Hello World' when learning a new language, 
I thought I would set a goal of writing a raytracer and perhaps render the 
text 'Hello 'World' in 3D. First, I need to know how to write a raytracer...

I am confident writing C#, so this is my raytracer learning project. I want to 
be able to:
* Render the shapes: spheres, cubes, planes, cylinders, cones, tori
* Have multiple colored point lights
* Have reflective surfaces 
* Implement a space-partitioning data structure (k-d tree, octree)
* Use JSON to describe a scene.

This is not meant to be the most effecient way of doing things, but instead is 
coded to be clear as to what is going on.
